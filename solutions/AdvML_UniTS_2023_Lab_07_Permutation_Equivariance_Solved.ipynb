    "The nowadays popular and growing subfield of _Geometric Deep Learning_ is concerned with the study of deep learning models explicitly designed to learn representations that are invariant/equivariant to certain transformations. Such goal is very often achieved thanks to a _deeper_ understanding of the mathematical properties of data, representations, and how a given model is able to capture them.\n"
